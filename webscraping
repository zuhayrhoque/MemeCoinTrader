#an attempt to webscrape the top 10 memecoins from https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token. failed but on the right track, I think i'm looking at the right elements on the webpage, head hurts too much to lock in
#for sammy: research beautifulsoup
#there's alot of ways this can go, but for starters let's have a program that successfuly scrapes and outputs 3 categories by the end of the week, then we work on a paper-trading bot, a rug pull detector, a pump-dump detector, or something else
